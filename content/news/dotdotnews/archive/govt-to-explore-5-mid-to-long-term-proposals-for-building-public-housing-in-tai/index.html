Residents of the remaining block have yet to be allowed to return home. As of yesterday, over 4,000 residents have been accommodated in transitional housing, Housing Society units, youth hostels, or government-arranged hotels. Chief Executive John Lee earlier directed the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Paul Chan, who leads the emergency accommodation task force, to coordinate relevant policy bureaus and departments in developing long-term resettlement solutions.

He indicated that the earliest selection of HOS flats could begin by mid-next year.<\/p> \n<p>It is understood that the Housing Authority\'s Subsidized Housing Committee will convene this Wednesday, traditionally to discuss arrangements for next year\'s HOS sales. Committee members have emphasized that if the resettlement of Wang Fuk Court residents involves the Housing Authority, the government should consult its views.<\/p> \n<p>Regarding the potential use of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court Assistance Fund to repurchase property rights, Chan noted that this option is under serious consideration. However, determining repurchase prices is challenging, as no transactions have occurred since the fire. \"The fund has nearly HK$3 billion remaining with unspecified allocations. If divided among over 1,000 households, each would receive slightly over HK$1 million. Many property owners understandably hope for higher repurchase prices.\" He stressed that the government is willing to consider using public funds to repurchase properties at reasonable prices if necessary.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Simplified Public Housing as an Alternative<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Chan also mentioned that affected residents could opt for Simplified Public Housing.

The psychological trauma experienced by residents must also be carefully considered.<\/p> \n<p>Legislative Council member and Housing Authority Committee member Scott\xA0Leung noted that public housing construction targets a 36-month timeline, though site preparation could extend this to about four years. With current HOS construction costs averaging HK$1.4 million per unit, resettling all Wang Fuk Court households could cost an estimated HK$2\u20133 billion. He emphasized that resettlement efforts should treat all residents equally, who may be reluctant to return due to psychological distress. For fire-damaged units without land premium payments, Leung urged the Housing Authority to clarify ownership responsibilities promptly. He suggested exploring compassionate rehousing options for affected elderly residents or tenants to move into public rental housing.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Related News:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8a4ae4b0c32d4f62fc89.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Watch This) Wang Fuk Court fire | Housing Department begins dismantling scaffolding on three blocks with large crane trucks deployed<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8165e4b0c32d4f62fbbc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang Fuk Court fire | Aid fund reaches HK$3.5 bn, over 4,200 affected residents relocate to emergency accommodation<\/a><\/p>','contentPageNumber':1,'contentType':0,'coverImages':[{'tag':null,'type':null,'url':'https://dw-media.dotdotnews.com/dams/product/image/202512/14/693e3dc7e4b08c07fcbc17a41.jpg'}],'coverStyle':0,'created':null,'createdBy':'','crumbs':[{'prUrl':'//english.dotdotnews.com','name':'\u9EDE\u65B0\u805E-dotdotnews','uri':'/','url':'https://english.dotdotnews.com'},{'prUrl':'//english.dotdotnews.com/hknews','name':'Hong Kong','uri':'/hknews','url':'https://english.dotdotnews.com/hknews'}],'description':'The devastating fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has affected nearly 2,000 households across eight residential blocks, leaving thousands of residents homeless.

He suggested exploring compassionate rehousing options for affected elderly residents or tenants to move into public rental housing.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Related News:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8a4ae4b0c32d4f62fc89.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Watch This) Wang Fuk Court fire | Housing Department begins dismantling scaffolding on three blocks with large crane trucks deployed<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8165e4b0c32d4f62fbbc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang Fuk Court fire | Aid fund reaches HK$3.5 bn, over 4,200 affected residents relocate to emergency accommodation<\/a><\/p>','prUrl':'//english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/14/AP693e3df8e4b0c32d4f633089.html','prettyPublishTime':'4 hours ago','primersTitle':'','properties':{'editor':'Jack Liu','smallTitle':null,'hotList_hide':'0','picNames':'\u5716\u72471','temporal_chain_hide':'0','searchType':null,'searchLocation':null,'columns':['5eb62161e4b0c3dbeefcf821','5ec50efbe4b048346665adc9'],'photoReptheName':[],'displayArea':'0','reviewEditor':'\u5289\u88D5','link_title':null,'videoReptheName':[],'textReptheName':[],'hide':'0','primeMoverIndustry':null,'ipAuthorId':null,'developType':null,'originalCategory':'1','shareLock':'0'},'publishStatus':1,'publishTime':'2025-12-14T19:30:00.000+08:00','published':'2025-12-14T19:30:00.000+08:00','recommends':null,'referenceStoryIds':[],'relatedStories':null,'responsibleEditor':'\u5289\u88D5','restorePath':null,'reviewEditor':'\u5289\u88D5','secretLevel':0,'share':null,'shareUrl':'https://english.dotdotnews.com/s/202512/14/AP693e3df8e4b0c32d4f633089.html','source':'','sourceId':'CO693e3906e4b004d13625cb6e','special':null,'specialId':null,'specialName':null,'specialPrUrl':null,'specialUrl':null,'story':{'attachedFiles':null,'atts':[],'author':'\u5289\u88D5','canComment':1,'category':0,'channelId':'somenewsen','columnId':'5eb62161e4b0c3dbeefcf821','columnNameTag':null,'comment':'','content':'<figure class=\"image align-center\" style=\"display:table;\"> \n <img src=\"https://dams.dotdotnews.com/dams/product/image/202512/14/693e3dbde4b08c07fcbc1793.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1200\" data-from=\"dams\" data-imgid=\"693e3dbea32fc5a41e397f5f\" data-dams-storyid=\"po693e3dc4e4b08c07fcbc1797\" data-mimetype=\"image/jpg\" data-resourcesrc=\"/product/image/202512/14/693e3dbde4b08c07fcbc1793.jpg\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" id=\"img-null\"> \n <figcaption style=\"display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom;\">\n   Govt to explore 5 mid-to-long-term proposals for building public housing in Tai Po to relocate Wang Fuk Court residents. (DDN) \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>The devastating fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has affected nearly 2,000 households across eight residential blocks, leaving thousands of residents homeless. The HKSAR government is now formulating long-term solutions to address residents\' resettlement needs, guided by the principles of compassion, reason, and law, to assist affected families in rebuilding their lives.<\/p> \n<p>Financial Secretary Paul Chan stated yesterday (Dec. 13) that the government will adopt a \"one household, one social worker\" approach to understand residents\' preferences. Within the coming weeks, five medium-to long-term options will be proposed, including constructing Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats in Tai Po and repurchasing property rights. Chan expressed confidence in identifying suitable sites within the Tai Po district and pledged to expedite construction to enable affected residents to be resettled within the same area.<\/p> \n<p>Of the eight residential blocks in Wang Fuk Court, seven were severely damaged by the fire, raising concerns about structural safety. Residents of the remaining block have yet to be allowed to return home. As of yesterday, over 4,000 residents have been accommodated in transitional housing, Housing Society units, youth hostels, or government-arranged hotels. Chief Executive John Lee earlier directed the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Paul Chan, who leads the emergency accommodation task force, to coordinate relevant policy bureaus and departments in developing long-term resettlement solutions. These measures will adhere to the principles of compassion, reason, and law, balancing residents\' individual circumstances and preferences with efficient resource allocation.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Social Workers to Assess Residents\' Preferences<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>In a radio program yesterday, Paul Chan mentioned that social workers will soon be deployed to understand residents\' preferences and present available options for consideration. He noted that affected residents need time to settle and that their views may evolve, with potential disagreements among family members. While the government will act swiftly, residents will be given adequate time to decide. Final decisions will be made on a weekly basis, with all options remaining under consideration.<\/p> \n<p>Many Hung Fuk Court residents have expressed a preference to remain in Tai Po. Recently, political parties have proposed potential sites for reconstructing the estate within the district. Chan stated that while no new HOS flats were originally planned for Tai Po in the coming years, the government is confident in identifying suitable land and expediting site assessments to shorten construction timelines. \"We are absolutely confident in finding appropriate sites to provide new HOS flats relatively quickly. If no prior planning had been done, construction might take five years or more. However, for Wang Fuk Court, we are confident in compressing this timeline. It is too early to specify the exact duration, as we need to assess the specifics.\"<\/p> \n<p><strong>Cross-district Option: HOS Flats Available Next Year<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Chan highlighted that the government plans to offer approximately 9,700 HOS flats for sale next year, significantly more than the annual average of around 4,000 units in recent years. Residents willing to consider cross-district options would not need to wait several years for local construction. He indicated that the earliest selection of HOS flats could begin by mid-next year.<\/p> \n<p>It is understood that the Housing Authority\'s Subsidized Housing Committee will convene this Wednesday, traditionally to discuss arrangements for next year\'s HOS sales. Committee members have emphasized that if the resettlement of Wang Fuk Court residents involves the Housing Authority, the government should consult its views.<\/p> \n<p>Regarding the potential use of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court Assistance Fund to repurchase property rights, Chan noted that this option is under serious consideration. However, determining repurchase prices is challenging, as no transactions have occurred since the fire. \"The fund has nearly HK$3 billion remaining with unspecified allocations. If divided among over 1,000 households, each would receive slightly over HK$1 million. Many property owners understandably hope for higher repurchase prices.\" He stressed that the government is willing to consider using public funds to repurchase properties at reasonable prices if necessary.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Simplified Public Housing as an Alternative<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Chan also mentioned that affected residents could opt for Simplified Public Housing. Projects in Chai Wan, Tuen Mun, and Kai Tak will gradually become operational by mid-next year, offering higher quality than typical transitional housing.<\/p> \n<p>Regarding on-site reconstruction, Chan cautioned that while the fire-damaged buildings are not at immediate risk of collapse, it does not mean they can be feasibly repaired. The psychological trauma experienced by residents must also be carefully considered.<\/p> \n<p>Legislative Council member and Housing Authority Committee member Scott\xA0Leung noted that public housing construction targets a 36-month timeline, though site preparation could extend this to about four years. With current HOS construction costs averaging HK$1.4 million per unit, resettling all Wang Fuk Court households could cost an estimated HK$2\u20133 billion. He emphasized that resettlement efforts should treat all residents equally, who may be reluctant to return due to psychological distress. For fire-damaged units without land premium payments, Leung urged the Housing Authority to clarify ownership responsibilities promptly. He suggested exploring compassionate rehousing options for affected elderly residents or tenants to move into public rental housing.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Related News:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8a4ae4b0c32d4f62fc89.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Watch This) Wang Fuk Court fire | Housing Department begins dismantling scaffolding on three blocks with large crane trucks deployed<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8165e4b0c32d4f62fbbc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang Fuk Court fire | Aid fund reaches HK$3.5 bn, over 4,200 affected residents relocate to emergency accommodation<\/a><\/p>','contentType':0,'created':'2025-12-14T19:30:01.067+08:00','createdBy':'system','description':'The devastating fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has affected nearly 2,000 households across eight residential blocks, leaving thousands of residents homeless.

   Govt to explore 5 mid-to-long-term proposals for building public housing in Tai Po to relocate Wang Fuk Court residents. (DDN) 
 </figcaption> 
</figure> 
<p>The devastating fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has affected nearly 2,000 households across eight residential blocks, leaving thousands of residents homeless. The HKSAR government is now formulating long-term solutions to address residents' resettlement needs, guided by the principles of compassion, reason, and law, to assist affected families in rebuilding their lives.</p> 
<p>Financial Secretary Paul Chan stated yesterday (Dec. 13) that the government will adopt a "one household, one social worker" approach to understand residents' preferences. Within the coming weeks, five medium-to long-term options will be proposed, including constructing Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats in Tai Po and repurchasing property rights. Chan expressed confidence in identifying suitable sites within the Tai Po district and pledged to expedite construction to enable affected residents to be resettled within the same area.</p> 
<p>Of the eight residential blocks in Wang Fuk Court, seven were severely damaged by the fire, raising concerns about structural safety. Residents of the remaining block have yet to be allowed to return home. As of yesterday, over 4,000 residents have been accommodated in transitional housing, Housing Society units, youth hostels, or government-arranged hotels. Chief Executive John Lee earlier directed the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Paul Chan, who leads the emergency accommodation task force, to coordinate relevant policy bureaus and departments in developing long-term resettlement solutions. These measures will adhere to the principles of compassion, reason, and law, balancing residents' individual circumstances and preferences with efficient resource allocation.</p> 
<p><strong>Social Workers to Assess Residents' Preferences</strong></p> 
<p>In a radio program yesterday, Paul Chan mentioned that social workers will soon be deployed to understand residents' preferences and present available options for consideration. He noted that affected residents need time to settle and that their views may evolve, with potential disagreements among family members. While the government will act swiftly, residents will be given adequate time to decide. Final decisions will be made on a weekly basis, with all options remaining under consideration.</p> 
<p>Many Hung Fuk Court residents have expressed a preference to remain in Tai Po. Recently, political parties have proposed potential sites for reconstructing the estate within the district. Chan stated that while no new HOS flats were originally planned for Tai Po in the coming years, the government is confident in identifying suitable land and expediting site assessments to shorten construction timelines. "We are absolutely confident in finding appropriate sites to provide new HOS flats relatively quickly. If no prior planning had been done, construction might take five years or more. However, for Wang Fuk Court, we are confident in compressing this timeline. It is too early to specify the exact duration, as we need to assess the specifics."</p> 
<p><strong>Cross-district Option: HOS Flats Available Next Year</strong></p> 
<p>Chan highlighted that the government plans to offer approximately 9,700 HOS flats for sale next year, significantly more than the annual average of around 4,000 units in recent years. Residents willing to consider cross-district options would not need to wait several years for local construction. He indicated that the earliest selection of HOS flats could begin by mid-next year.</p> 
<p>It is understood that the Housing Authority's Subsidized Housing Committee will convene this Wednesday, traditionally to discuss arrangements for next year's HOS sales. Committee members have emphasized that if the resettlement of Wang Fuk Court residents involves the Housing Authority, the government should consult its views.</p> 
<p>Regarding the potential use of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court Assistance Fund to repurchase property rights, Chan noted that this option is under serious consideration. However, determining repurchase prices is challenging, as no transactions have occurred since the fire. "The fund has nearly HK$3 billion remaining with unspecified allocations. If divided among over 1,000 households, each would receive slightly over HK$1 million. Many property owners understandably hope for higher repurchase prices." He stressed that the government is willing to consider using public funds to repurchase properties at reasonable prices if necessary.</p> 
<p><strong>Simplified Public Housing as an Alternative</strong></p> 
<p>Chan also mentioned that affected residents could opt for Simplified Public Housing. Projects in Chai Wan, Tuen Mun, and Kai Tak will gradually become operational by mid-next year, offering higher quality than typical transitional housing.</p> 
<p>Regarding on-site reconstruction, Chan cautioned that while the fire-damaged buildings are not at immediate risk of collapse, it does not mean they can be feasibly repaired. The psychological trauma experienced by residents must also be carefully considered.</p> 
<p>Legislative Council member and Housing Authority Committee member Scott&nbsp;Leung noted that public housing construction targets a 36-month timeline, though site preparation could extend this to about four years. With current HOS construction costs averaging HK$1.4 million per unit, resettling all Wang Fuk Court households could cost an estimated HK$2–3 billion. He emphasized that resettlement efforts should treat all residents equally, who may be reluctant to return due to psychological distress. For fire-damaged units without land premium payments, Leung urged the Housing Authority to clarify ownership responsibilities promptly. He suggested exploring compassionate rehousing options for affected elderly residents or tenants to move into public rental housing.</p>
