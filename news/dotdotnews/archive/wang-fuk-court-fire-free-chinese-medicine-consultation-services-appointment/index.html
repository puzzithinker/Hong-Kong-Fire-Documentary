These will be arranged through the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across Hong Kong\'s 18 districts and will include necessary medications and treatments based on clinical assessment.<\/p> \n<p>The free consultations cover health issues potentially arising from the fire, such as:<\/p> \n<ul> \n <li>Emotional distress, insomnia, and palpitations<\/li> \n <li>Coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and sore throat<\/li> \n <li>General weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and indigestion<\/li> \n <li>Pain and musculoskeletal injuries<\/li> \n<\/ul> \n<p>Affected residents in need can seek assistance by calling dedicated hotlines or visiting any DHC in person, irrespective of their current residence. Registered DHC members may also contact their respective DHC directly. Hotline numbers are available on the PHC Commission and DHC websites. DHC case managers will match individuals with participating CM practitioners based on their specific situation and preferences.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Hospital (CMHHK)<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>All residents of the eight affected blocks (including foreign domestic helpers) and all individuals injured in the fire who were admitted to Hospital Authority (HA) public hospitals are eligible for full fee waivers at the CMHHK until December 31, 2026. This covers all government-subsidized services, including General and Specialized Clinics, Allied Health Services, day-patient services, as well as specific Western medicine diagnostic procedures and discharge medications. Eligible individuals should identify themselves at the CMHHK and provide basic personal details (name, ID number, and address) during consultation to facilitate arrangements.<\/p> \n<p><strong>18-District Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs)<\/strong><\/p> \n<p>Following the fire, CMCTRs under the HA in Sha Tin, Tai Po, and the North Districts provided immediate support by enhancing services, rescheduling appointments, and re-dispensing medicines.<\/p> \n<p>Since Dec. 2, all 18 CMCTRs have extended full support to residents of the eight affected blocks (including foreign domestic helpers). They are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31, 2026, covering government-subsidized CM outpatient services like general consultation, acupuncture, and bone-setting/tui-na. Relevant individuals can call the CMCTRs during service hours or book via the \"18 CM Clinics\" mobile app. They must identify themselves and provide basic personal information upon registration. The CMCTRs will prioritize appointments for affected residents. Additionally, the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine Services at HA hospitals/centres (currently covering six disease areas) will also waive fees for eligible individuals.<\/p> \n<p>Details of the 18 CMCTRs are available on the <a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://cmk.ha.org.hk/services/notice/tai-po-fire-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HA Chinese Medicine website<\/a>.<\/p> \n<p>The HHB extends its gratitude to the CM sector and non-governmental organizations for their dedicated support to the affected residents. The Government will continue to coordinate various medical services to support the physical and mental health recovery of the residents.<\/p> \n<p><strong>Related News:<\/strong><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8a4ae4b0c32d4f62fc89.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Watch This) Wang Fuk Court fire | Housing Department begins dismantling scaffolding on three blocks with large crane trucks deployed<\/a><\/p> \n<p><a style=\"color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://english.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/12/AP693b8165e4b0c32d4f62fbbc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang Fuk Court fire | Aid fund reaches HK$3.5 bn, over 4,200 affected residents relocate to emergency accommodation<\/a><\/p>','contentType':0,'created':'2025-12-14T18:31:02.313+08:00','createdBy':'system','description':'The Health Bureau (HHB) announced on Dec. 14 that free Chinese Medicine (CM) consultation services will be made available from Dec. 15 for residents impacted by the fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po.

   Free Chinese medicine consultation services appointment available starting tomorrow. (DotDotNews) 
 </figcaption> 
</figure> 
<p>The Health Bureau (HHB) announced on Dec. 14 that free Chinese Medicine (CM) consultation services will be made available from Dec. 15 for residents impacted by the fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po. Additional CM services have also been mobilized to comprehensively address their healthcare needs.</p> 
<p><strong>Free CM Consultation Services</strong></p> 
<p>To ensure more holistic medical support for the affected residents, free CM consultations will commence tomorrow. Coordinated by the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the HHB's Chinese Medicine Unit, 150 CM practitioners are participating in this initiative, which spans over 170 service points. From December 15, 2024, to February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight affected blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for up to three free CM consultations. These will be arranged through the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across Hong Kong's 18 districts and will include necessary medications and treatments based on clinical assessment.</p> 
<p>The free consultations cover health issues potentially arising from the fire, such as:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Emotional distress, insomnia, and palpitations</li> 
 <li>Coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and sore throat</li> 
 <li>General weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and indigestion</li> 
 <li>Pain and musculoskeletal injuries</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Affected residents in need can seek assistance by calling dedicated hotlines or visiting any DHC in person, irrespective of their current residence. Registered DHC members may also contact their respective DHC directly. Hotline numbers are available on the PHC Commission and DHC websites. DHC case managers will match individuals with participating CM practitioners based on their specific situation and preferences.</p> 
<p><strong>Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Hospital (CMHHK)</strong></p> 
<p>All residents of the eight affected blocks (including foreign domestic helpers) and all individuals injured in the fire who were admitted to Hospital Authority (HA) public hospitals are eligible for full fee waivers at the CMHHK until December 31, 2026. This covers all government-subsidized services, including General and Specialized Clinics, Allied Health Services, day-patient services, as well as specific Western medicine diagnostic procedures and discharge medications. Eligible individuals should identify themselves at the CMHHK and provide basic personal details (name, ID number, and address) during consultation to facilitate arrangements.</p> 
<p><strong>18-District Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs)</strong></p> 
<p>Following the fire, CMCTRs under the HA in Sha Tin, Tai Po, and the North Districts provided immediate support by enhancing services, rescheduling appointments, and re-dispensing medicines.</p> 
<p>Since Dec. 2, all 18 CMCTRs have extended full support to residents of the eight affected blocks (including foreign domestic helpers). They are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31, 2026, covering government-subsidized CM outpatient services like general consultation, acupuncture, and bone-setting/tui-na. Relevant individuals can call the CMCTRs during service hours or book via the "18 CM Clinics" mobile app. They must identify themselves and provide basic personal information upon registration. The CMCTRs will prioritize appointments for affected residents. Additionally, the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine Services at HA hospitals/centres (currently covering six disease areas) will also waive fees for eligible individuals.</p> 
<p>Details of the 18 CMCTRs are available on the <a style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;" href="https://cmk.ha.org.hk/services/notice/tai-po-fire-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HA Chinese Medicine website</a>.</p> 
<p>The HHB extends its gratitude to the CM sector and non-governmental organizations for their dedicated support to the affected residents. The Government will continue to coordinate various medical services to support the physical and mental health recovery of the residents.</p>
